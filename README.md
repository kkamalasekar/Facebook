# Points to be noted:
  1. I have used Java-Selenium-Cucumber in a BDD approach
  2. Used Maven as my build tool
  3. Called out my assumptions and comments inside the clases
  4. Since this is just happy path scenario, I have randomized email and date fields
  5. Browser selection can be done via project.properties. For now used Chrome only
  6. Requires Java 8
